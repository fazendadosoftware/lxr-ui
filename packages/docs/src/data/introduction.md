# Introduction

## Hi there developer!

**Lxr-UI** is a Component Library for Vue 3. It is intended to speed up the development process of LeanIX Custom Reports.
We try as much as possible to mimic the look and feel of the native LeanIX UI in our components, so that you can create professionally looking reports with minimal overhead.
