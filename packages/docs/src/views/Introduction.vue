          <b>Lxr-UI</b> is a Component Library for Vue 3. It is intended to speed up the development process of LeanIX Custom Reports.
          <br>We try as much as possible to mimic the look and feel of the native LeanIX UI in our components, so that you can create professionally looking reports
          with minimal overhead.
